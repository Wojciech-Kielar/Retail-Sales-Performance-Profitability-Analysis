# Retail Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution designed to analyze retail sales performance, profitability drivers, geographic distribution, and time-based trends.

The objective was to transform transactional data into a structured analytical model and executive-level dashboard supporting strategic decision-making.

---

## Business Context

Retail organizations often face challenges such as:

- High revenue but low profitability
- Uneven geographic performance
- Hidden loss-driving product categories
- Seasonal volatility in sales

This project addresses these issues through structured KPI analysis and interactive dashboard design.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL (data transformation, aggregation, KPI logic)
- Tableau (interactive BI dashboards)
- Excel (data validation & exploratory checks)

---

## Data Workflow Architecture

1. Raw transactional data validation
2. SQL-based aggregation and KPI calculations
3. Profitability segmentation (Category / Sub-Category / State)
4. Time-series performance analysis
5. Executive dashboard implementation in Tableau

---

## Dashboard Structure

The final BI solution consists of three interconnected dashboards:

### 1. Executive Overview
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Profit Margin
- Loss Order %
- Category performance comparison

### 2. Geographic Performance Analysis
- Filled map visualization
- Profit distribution by state
- Identification of high-risk and high-opportunity regions

### 3. Time & Performance Trends
- Monthly sales trend
- Monthly profit trend
- Seasonality patterns
- Performance fluctuations over time

## Key Analytical Insights

- Revenue volume does not guarantee profitability.
- Certain sub-categories generate consistent losses despite strong sales.
- Geographic profitability disparities significantly impact overall margin.
- Clear seasonality patterns influence revenue performance.
