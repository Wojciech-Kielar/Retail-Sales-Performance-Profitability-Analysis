## Executive Summary

## Business Objective
The goal of this analysis was to:

- Evaluate overall business profitability
- Identify high and low performing product categories
- Analyze geographic profit distribution across states
- Detect time-based performance patterns and seasonality
- Build an interactive executive dashboard for decision support

- **Tableau** – interactive dashboard development
- **Excel** – initial validation and exploratory checks
